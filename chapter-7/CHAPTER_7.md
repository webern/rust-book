Crate vs. Package

**Package**
- A Rust package has one `Cargo.toml` file.
- A Rust package can define one library (`lib.rs`) and multiple binaries (such as `main.rs`).
- A Rust package can have multiple crates.

**Crate**
- A Rust crate is either a library or a binary.
- It represents an end-product that the compiler will produce (i.e. a lib or bin).
